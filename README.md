# ToDo list with vanilla JavaScript

This is a project coded by me as part of the Udemy's training course
[_"JavaScript Moderno: Gu√≠a para dominar el lenguaje"_ (by Fernando
Herrera)](https://www.udemy.com/course/javascript-fernando-herrera/).

On it I mainly used **events handling, ES6 syntax, classes and LocalStorage**
(to save the last status of the list even if the site is refreshed or the web
browser closed / restarted).

The development process and the final compilation (files on the docs directory)
has been done using Node.js, NPM and Webpack.
